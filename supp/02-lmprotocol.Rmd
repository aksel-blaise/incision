# Landmarking protocol

The characteristic points and tangents used in this landmarking protocol were inspired by the pioneering work of Birkhoff [-@RN11786].

Using Geomagic Design X, a plane was inserted to capture the deepest incision profile.

```{r insertplane, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# incision image
knitr::include_graphics('images/insertplane.png')
fig.cap="Reference plane (blue) inserted at deepest point of incision of experimental tile 6b."
```

The horizontal tangent was calculated for the rise in the clay matrix on either side of the incision, followed by the calculation of linear distance between them to identify the mid-point of the incision. The deepest part of the incision profile was always oriented to the right of center.

```{r h.tangent, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# incision image
knitr::include_graphics('images/h-tangents.png')
fig.cap="Spline (500 interpolation points) that was cut at the location of horizontal tangents on each side, then oriented where the deepest part of the incision was to the right of center."
```

Once properly oriented, the horizontal tangent on the left was assigned as landmark (LM) 01, and the tangent on the right as LM 02. Twenty five equidistant landmarks were placed between the two landmarks along the spline.

```{r semi.land, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# incision image
knitr::include_graphics('images/semiland.png')
fig.cap="Placement of 25 equidistant semilandmarks (white) between LM01 and LM02 (blue)"
```

Landmarks and semilandmarks for each specimen were exported as CSV files (included in supplemental materials as dataEX).
