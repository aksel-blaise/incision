## 41SA66

The David Fox site is located in the Angelina National Forest on a high terrace overlooking the Attoyac Bayou floodplain and a small tributary. The site was described by Stephenson [-@RN5040] as being ``small and culturally poor,'' and was under cultivation at that time [@RN793].

There are Woodland period and pre-CE 1200 Caddo components at 41SA66. The Woodland component includes eight _Goose Creek Plain_ body sherds from surface contexts [@RN5066, 57, Pl. 29]. The Caddo component is evidenced by 11 grog-tempered rim and body sherds. Three of the rims bear multiple (5-12 lines) horizontal incised lines, and three body sherds include 7-12 parallel incised lines. The other five sherds---four body sherds and a body/base sherd---are plain.

## 41SB125

Located in the Sabine National Forest, 41SB125 includes both Woodland and post-CE 1200 Caddo components. Diagnostic artifacts from the Woodland period component include 42 _Goose Creek Plain_ body sherds from eight shovel tests; these were recovered between 20-60 cmbs. There is another sandy paste sherd with incised and stamped decorative elements, potentially a Marksville Stamped body sherd [@RN5635, 65-74]. 

The Caddo component is marked by seven grog-tempered body sherds from four shovel tests, ranging from 20-75 cmbs. Three are plain grog-tempered body sherds. The decorated sherds include a body sherd with a single straight incised line (ST 20, 20-30 cmbs), another body sherd with parallel brushing marks (ST 11, 20-30 cmbs), a rim with a triangular incised zone filled with rows of cane punctates, and a body sherd with an incised zone filled with diagonal incised lines.

## 41SB189

There are several archeological components at 41SB189 in the Sabine National Forest. The earliest may date to the Middle Archaic period, based on the recovery of a possible Johnson dart point from Mound D that was manufactured from non-local white chert. Late Archaic use of the site is marked by a Williams dart point from Mound D that was manufactured from silicified wood.

The Woodland component at 41SB189 is more substantial, includes a chert Gary point from Mound A, three Friley arrow points (chert), and 15 _Goose Creek Plain_ body sherds. These were found in shovel tests, and range between 0-50 cmbs in Mounds A and H.

Temporally diagnostic artifacts indicate that the Caddo occupation at the site occurred during the Early Caddo period (CE 1000-1200). That assertion is based on the recovery of an Alba point from Mound A made of chert. The final Caddo occupation occurred after CE 1400, and includes a Bassett arrow point from Mound D made from chert, as well as grog-tempered body sherds from Mound A and D recovered between 0-60 cmbs in different shovel tests. Sherds recovered from that component include seven plain body sherds, and five decorated body sherds. One decorated sherd from Mound A includes parallel brushing marks, two others from Mound D exhibit parallel incised lines, and another bears a single engraved line. The last decorated body sherd comes from what may have been a carinated bowl found in looter backfill that was excavated from Mound D, which has diagonal opposed engraved lines.

## 41SB291

Woodland and post-CE 1200 ancestral Caddo components at 41SB291 in the Sabine National Forest. The Woodland material culture remains include seven Goose Creek Plain, \textit{var. unspecified} \citep[57, Pl. 29]{Suhm:1} body sherds from four different shovel tests (20-60 cm bs) as well as three dart points and a petrified wood biface preform. The dart points include Gary \citep[197, Pl. 99]{Suhm:1} and Kent \citep[199, Pl. 100]{Suhm:1} points made from petrified wood and a black chert dart point blade and tip fragment.

Other chipped stone tools include a petrified wood early stage biface (ST 9, 20-30 cmbs) and a petrified wood biface tip (ST 12, 60-70 cmbs). There are also five unilateral flake tools in the assemblage of petrified wood, quartzite, a non-local black chert, and local reddish-brown chert from ST 16, 18, 21, 51, and 52 (0-60 cmbs).

The ancestral Caddo component is marked by four grog and/or bone-tempered rim and body sherds. One rim from ST 61 (50-55 cmbs) has vertical brushing marks (indicative of a post-CE 1200 Caddo vessel in this part of East Texas), and a body sherd from ST 64 (30-40 cm bs) has parallel incised lines. The other two sherds are plain, including a body sherd from ST 51 (20-30 cmbs) and a rim sherd from ST 26 (30-40 cmbs). The rim is direct with a rounded lip.
