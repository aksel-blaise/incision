# Experimental sample

The experimental sample consisted of seven test tiles that were incised and fired to Cone 06 at the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The tiles were later transported to the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training where they were scanned, then to the Heritage Research Center at Stephen F. Austin State University for the analysis.

## Experimental tiles

The clay used for the experimental tiles was Red Stone from Highwater Clays. Each tile was moved to a dry box 15 minutes after the incision was made. The tiles were fired in five stages using an electric kiln at the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts:

|Stage | Rate/Hr   | Temp   | Hold
|:----:|:---------:|:------:|:-----------------------
| 1    | 100/hr    | 190&deg;F| Hold for seven hours
| 2    | 200/hr    | 400&deg;F| Hold for 10 minutes
| 3    | 250/hr    | 600&deg;F| Hold for 10 minutes
| 4    | 400/hr    |1200&deg;F| Hold for 10 minutes
| 5    | 500/hr    |1800&deg;F| Hold for 10 minutes

Royal Sovereign, Ltd, (UK) manufactured the chisels used to create the incisions, which included size 10/flat, size 9/flat, size 2/cup round, size 0/cup round, and size 0/cup chisel.

Experimental tile 1 included an impression of the chisel tip on each instrument, and was not included in the experimental sample. Experimental tiles 2-8 included two incisions on each tile. In some cases two scans were generated for a tile, capturing the incision of interest nearest the center of the scan. 

A Keyence VR-5000 optical profilometer was used to capture each three-dimensional image, which was rendered in the VR Series (VR-3000 G2 Series) Analyzer Software, then exported to Geomagic Design X (version 2019.0.3) where the landmarks were applied.

## Landmarking protocol

The characteristic points and tangents used in the landmarking protocol were inspired by the work of Birkhoff [-@RN11786]. Using Geomagic Design X, a plane was inserted to capture the deepest incision profile on each scan.

```{r insertplane, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# incision image
knitr::include_graphics('images/insertplane.png')
fig.cap="Reference plane (blue) inserted at deepest point of incision of experimental tile 6b."
```

The horizontal tangent was calculated for the rise in the clay matrix that occurrs on each side of the incision. A linear distance was then calculated to identify the mid-point of the incision, and the deepest part of the incision was always oriented to the right of center. 

```{r h.tangent, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# incision image
knitr::include_graphics('images/h-tangents.png')
fig.cap="Spline (500 interpolation points) that was cut at the location of horizontal tangents on each side, then oriented where the deepest part of the incision was to the right of center."
```

Once properly oriented, the horizontal tangent of the left was assigned as Point (LM01), and the horizontal tangent on the right as Point (LM02). Twenty five equidistant landmarks were then placed between the two landmarks along a spline.

```{r semi.land, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# incision image
knitr::include_graphics('images/semiland.png')
fig.cap="Placement of 25 equidistant semilandmarks (white) between LM01 and LM02 (blue)"
```

Landmarks and semilandmarks for each specimen were then exported as CSV files (included in supplemental materials as dataEX), which were used in the geometric morphometric analysis presented in the next chapter.
