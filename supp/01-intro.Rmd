# Introduction

This document contains supplementary materials associated with the article, _"Does similar ceramic incision morphology provide inference to a common toolkit?"_ The volume is organised by chapter, and details the samples and geometric morphometric analyses associated with the experimental and archaeological materials. Images of each sample are included; however, the processed and unprocessed 3D scan data are embargoed for a period of five years from the most recent submission that leverages them.

The incision project is part of a long-term research programme, representing an expansion of previous efforts to better comprehend the vagaries associated with ceramic [@RN1994;@RN11521;@RN11782;@RN11801;@RN11716] and lithic morphology [@RN11783;@RN21001], which provided insights into inter- and intraspecific _shape differences_ and _shape changes_ that articulate in and among various categories of Caddo material culture [@RN20697]. This exploratory analysis of Caddo incision morphology was designed to augment current analytical approaches related to the archaeological study of ceramic manufacture and production. The study achieves this through a geometric morphometric analysis of incised marks applied by Caddo potters. Like the bottle and biface analyses, the landmark configuration associated with the incisions will likely change in subsequent iterations; however, the general idea is to better understand the character of the Caddo toolkit used to apply incisions.

The genesis of this project occurred during a slip, glazing, and atmospheric firing workshop at the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, where access to the materials, dry box, and electric kilns provided a means to produce the experimental sample. The archaeological sample was provided with permission and support from the Caddo Tribe of Oklahoma, and comes from sites on the Angelina, Davy Crockett, and Sabine National Forests, which are units of the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (NFGT). Partial funding for this project came from a Media Grant to the Caddo Tribe of Oklahoma through the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT), and additional funding was provided by grants from the NFGT (15-PA-11081300-033 and 20-PA-11081300-074). NCPTT provided access and training for the optical profilometer used to generate 3D meshes for the experimental and archaeological samples at their laboratory in Natchitoches, Louisiana, as well as a copy of the Keyence VR Series Analyzer Software that was used to render and export the meshes.

The landmarking protocol (see Section 2.2) is identical on both the experimental and archaeological samples, and was designed to capture the profile of the business end of the instrument used to apply each incision. One insight made clear by the experimental analysis is that a single tool could have been used to apply incisions that render differing marks in profile. Since incisions are made while the clay body is not yet dry, the range of variation is potentially greater than that of engraved or etched designs, and the deepest profile of each incision should provide the most complete profile of the tool employed by Caddo potters to apply the marks.
